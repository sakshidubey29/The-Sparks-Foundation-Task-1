# The-Sparks-Foundation-Task-1
### Prediction using Supervised ML

> Since it involve only **Two Variables** that are Score and number of Study Hours so, it's a **Simple Linear Regression.**
---
## Steps:
1. I Imported all the required Libraries and Data.
2. Then, I plotted Distribution of scores with respect to Hours
3. After that, Prepared data to Train the Model.
4. Later, Plotted Regression Line and data
5. Then, I Predicted what would be score of Student if he/she Studied 9.25 Hours/day.

  **Predicted Score = 93.69173248737538**
